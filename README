Résuméweb

This is a small tool I'm writing with Django to manage a web-based Résumé. Currently, it's an excerpt of a larger project I was working on, but I'm generalizing it a bit and trying to make it more robust.

To install, download the source and unpack to whereever you want it to reside. Then configure the app to run through Apache (I'd suggest using wsgi, and I provide files to do this). Check online if you need help deploying a Django app.

Then, log into the admin ui and edit your Résumé. The only publicly accesible page will be the resume itself.

The formatting for the Résumé was adapted from: http://css-tricks.com/5191-one-page-resume-site/
